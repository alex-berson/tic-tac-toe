## Description

**Tic-tac-toe**, also known as **Noughts and Crosses** or **Xs and Os**, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns placing marks (Xs for the first player and Os for the second) on a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to get three matching marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. If all squares are occupied but neither player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.
